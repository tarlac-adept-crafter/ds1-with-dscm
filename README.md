# Dark Souls PTDE Launch Script with DSCM

Wulf's Dark Souls Connection Manager (DSCM) is amazing, but I keep forgetting 
where I put it!

This script launches Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition through Steam and opens 
your installation of DSCM.

*Note:* This script is not affiliated with DSCM or Dark Souls in any way.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10\*
- Steam
- Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition through Steam\*\*
- [Wulf's DSCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1047/)

\* This script has only been tested on Windows 10, but it should work on 
Windows 7. I have no clue if it will work on anything older than that, but 
please let me know if you find out!

\*\* To my knowledge, Dark Souls Remastered does not need DSCM, so this script
is useless for it. You can still modify the script to launch it if you want to,
though!

## Usage

1. Download this repository (or just copy/paste the raw script text into your
  own script file).
2. Copy/cut/paste the `ds1_dscm_launcher.bat` script to wherever you want it.
3. Open the file in your preferred text editor (like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)). Make sure you
  right-click the file and select "Edit"! Double-clicking the script will run 
  it.
4. 
5. Double-click the script to run it. Dark Souls should launch through Steam
  and DSCM with start.
  
### Optional

- Create a Desktop shortcut to the script. You can also put the 
  script directly on your Desktop.
- Rename the script/shortcut.
- Change the script or shortcut icon. 
    - To do this, right-click the script/shortcut, click "Properties". Under
      the "Shortcut" tab, click "Change Icon...", click "OK" on the window 
      about no icons in the current file appears, and "Browse..." for an icon.
    - Steam game icons are usually stored in \`path/to/Steam/steam/games\`. The
      game executable will also usually have an icon you can select.

## Modification

and you can do whatever you want with it (not legal advice), so have fun
using and modifying it to your heart's content! The only thing I ask, and this
is not required at all, is that you let me know what cool things you do with
it or any lessons you learned that I could apply as well!
